- the stack will start after the kernel
##### AT&T Syntax
- suffixes determine how many bytes are processed
- instructions that change <32 bits preserves the rest of the register
- note: X86 will truncate if the constant is larger than the destination
- $: constant
- %: register
- no $: memory address

##### Computed Addresses
- **displacement(base, index, scale) = base + (index * scale) + displacement**
- base = starting point in memory
- scale = size of value (limited to 1, 2, 4, 8)
- displacement and base are signed
